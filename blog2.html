        <small>July 21,2021</small>
          <p><strong>What is an HTTP request ? </strong>
           An HTTP request basically is an action performed on a resource identifies by a given Request URL.
           There are various HTTP request methods and each one is assigned a speicific purpose.  Request methods are case sensitive and hence are always written in upper case. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3 class="sub-heading">How do HTTP requests work?</h3>

            HTTP requests are an intermediate transportation method between a client and a server. What actually happens is that a client sends a request(HTTP request) to the server, and the server processes that request and returns a back a response about the asked request. So in this way as we can notice, an HTTP request helps in communication between client and server.

            <h3 class="sub-heading">Different types of HTTP requests.</h3>
            <p>
            <strong>1. GET</strong>
            Many of us might have used GET request while working with forms. <br><strong>So what actually a GET request is?</strong><br>
            BAsically, a GET request requests the data from a specific resource to which the GET request is sent. GET request is sent in header, therefore only a limited amount of data can be sent. GET request should not be used for sending secure data because the data is exposed in the URL bar.
            When we make two GET requests one after another, the second request will not be considered unless the first request is delivered.
            So this is how a GET request works.

            <h3 class="sub-heading">A new beginning</h3>
            <p>I started my journey with neogcamp youtube videos. And this time as i started, there were no second thoughts because this time I knew I was going right and this is all I want to do.
            So I started my journey with neogcamp

        <h3 class="sub-heading">Basics Of Javascript</h3>
        <p>
            As i got started with the videos, the first task was to learn basics of Javascript and get started toward making of my First CLI App. 
            Following the video, we started with the very basic that what a variable is and how to declare it.
            <ol>
                <li><b>How to declare a variable</b></li>
                <p>
                    var <variable-name> = (value);
                </p>
                <li><b>How to take input from user</b> </li>

                <p>
                  var username = readlineSync.question("What is your name ?")
                </p>
                <li><b>How to output something</b> </li>
                <p>
                    console.log("Hello")
                </p>
                <li><b>If else statement </b></li>
                <p>
                    if (condition) {
                        //  block of code to be executed if the condition is true
                      } else {
                        //  block of code to be executed if the condition is false
                      }
                </p>
                <li><b>For loop </b></li>
                <p>
                    for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
                        // code block to be executed
                      }
                </p>

                <li><b>Functions</b> </li>
                <p>
                    function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
                        // code to be executed
                      }
                      
                </p>
            </ol>
        
            <h3 class="sub-heading">My first cli app</h3>
            <p>
                After going through the basics of Javascript, I made my first CLI App using these basics in which i made a quiz "HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW ME" In this quiz, a user will be asked to enter his her name and will then be asked questions about me. If the user gets correct answer, he will be awarded a point, and if wrong, a point will be subtracted. 
                You can refer to the code of my app<a class="link"
                href="https://github.com/tiwarikratika/FirstCliApp-NeogCamp"
                >here</a>
            </p>

            <p>
                P.s. I know it was not a very great app to write a blog about, but it was surely a beginning to my new journey towards my web development.
                This is also my first blog.
