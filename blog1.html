        <small>July 12,2021</small>
          <p><strong>A short story : </strong>
            Until my third year in college, I never exactly knew what should I should i go for. Should I learn front end or Should I go for backend or Should I learn all of it. All of the people around me have figured things out and were working on something or the other. And I was busy thinking that what should I start with. I tried my hands on frontend,backend, I tried going for ML but could never decide and left all incomplete.

            And then TanayPratap happened.

            <h3 class="sub-heading">Where and how did i start?</h3>
            <p>
            One day just while I was on youtube watching Django tutorials, a suggestion to his video appeared on the screen and thankfully that was one of the best thing that happened in my 3 years of Btech.
            I went through his youtube channel nad got to know about NeogCamp and from that very day I wanted to join it. 
            I went through the first video and I realised that to get into Neog level 1, I will have to complete level0 which basically involved step by step teaching by Tanay Pratap himself and following what he said. 
            <br> So that is how i started my journey to become a web developer. The way he taught, with an ease simplifying things was something i always wanted.

            <br>

            <h3 class="sub-heading">A new beginning</h3>
            <p>I started my journey with neogcamp youtube videos. And this time as i started, there were no second thoughts because this time I knew I was going right and this is all I want to do.
            So I started my journey with neogcamp

        <h3 class="sub-heading">Basics Of Javascript</h3>
        <p>
            As i got started with the videos, the first task was to learn basics of Javascript and get started toward making of my First CLI App. 
            Following the video, we started with the very basic that what a variable is and how to declare it.
            <ol>
                <li><b>How to declare a variable</b></li>
                <p>
                    var <variable-name> = (value);
                </p>
                <li><b>How to take input from user</b> </li>

                <p>
                  var username = readlineSync.question("What is your name ?")
                </p>
                <li><b>How to output something</b> </li>
                <p>
                    console.log("Hello")
                </p>
                <li><b>If else statement </b></li>
                <p>
                    if (condition) {
                        //  block of code to be executed if the condition is true
                      } else {
                        //  block of code to be executed if the condition is false
                      }
                </p>
                <li><b>For loop </b></li>
                <p>
                    for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
                        // code block to be executed
                      }
                </p>

                <li><b>Functions</b> </li>
                <p>
                    function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
                        // code to be executed
                      }
                      
                </p>
            </ol>
        
            <h3 class="sub-heading">My first cli app</h3>
            <p>
                After going through the basics of Javascript, I made my first CLI App using these basics in which i made a quiz "HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW ME" In this quiz, a user will be asked to enter his her name and will then be asked questions about me. If the user gets correct answer, he will be awarded a point, and if wrong, a point will be subtracted. 
                You can refer to the code of my app<a class="link"
                href="https://github.com/tiwarikratika/FirstCliApp-NeogCamp"
                >here</a>
            </p>

            <p>
                P.s. I know it was not a very great app to write a blog about, but it was surely a beginning to my new journey towards my web development.
                This is also my first blog.
